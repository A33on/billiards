    <h2>Billiards, pool and snooker</h2>
    <main>
        <div>
            <p>Billiards, pool and snooker are played indoors on a pocket table.</p>
            <h3>Pool</h3>
            <p>The following specifications are standard for equipment used at all World Pool-Billiard Association
                sanctioned and/or recognised events. These specifications do not apply to tables manufactured for
                commercial home use. The design of a pool/billiard table must not have any sharp edges or materials that
                will cause injury or damage to clothes.</p>
            <p>Pool is played on a pocket billiard table with one white cue ball and 15 numbered object balls. It can be
                played by two individuals, pairs or teams. Points are scored for pocketing designated balls in
                designated pockets. The first player or side to reach an agreed number of points wins the game.</p>
            <h3>Table</h3>
            <p>A ‘9 foot’ pool table has a playing surface of 2.54m long and 1.27m wide and an ‘8 foot’ pool table is
                2.34m long and 1.17m wide. The length of a pool table is always twice the width.</p>
            <p>Billiard, snooker and pool tables are covered in a fabric with a minimum of 85 per cent combined worsted
                wool and no more than 15 per cent nylon. Yellow-green, blue-green and electric blue are acceptable for
                competition.</p>
            <p>There are six pockets in snooker and pool tables — two at the top end called the ‘top’ pockets, one each
                at the middle of the longer sides called ‘centre’ pockets and two at the bottom end called ‘bottom’
                pockets.</p>
            <h3>Space about table</h3>
            <p>Recommended minimum space about the table is 2.5m (absolute minimum is 1.6m).</p>
            <h3>Equipment</h3>
            <p>Cue sticks used at competitions must be a minimum length of 1.016m and a maximum weight of 708.75g. The
                tip must be no wider than 14mm.</p>
            <h3>Balls</h3>
            <p>A set of pool balls consists of one white cue ball and 15 colour-coded numbered balls. The balls numbered
                1 through 8 have solid colours and the balls numbered 9 through 15 are white with a centre band of
                colour. The balls are 52.5mm in diameter and are coloured and numbered as follows:</p>
